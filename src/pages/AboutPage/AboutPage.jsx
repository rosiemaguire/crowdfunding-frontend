      <h1>What is Advocat?</h1>
      <p>
        Advocat is a crowdfunding website to help people raise money for their
        fur children&apos;s medical bills.

      <h3>Why &quot;Advocat&quot;?</h3>
      <p>
        Advocat is a play on the words &quot;advocate&quot; and &quot;cat&quot;. Advocat is all
        about being advocates for our and others pets. We believe that pets are
        just as important as any other family member.
